Create a React application that includes a table with five columns, where the table has pagination represented by a progress bar? The application should have the following features:

1. A "Next" button either beside or below the progress bar labeled as "Pagination Progress Bar."
2. Upon clicking the button:
   - The progress bar should animate from 0% to 100% over a period of 3 seconds and then return to the current page state.
   - If the button is clicked multiple times, progress bar animations should queue up, starting only after the previous animation finishes.
   - Progress bars should appear sequentially, ensuring each bar starts only after the prior bar completes its animation.
   
What steps would you take to implement this functionality, and how would you ensure the animations are handled sequentially?
